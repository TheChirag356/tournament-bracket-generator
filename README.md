# How a Tournament Generator Works

A **tournament generator** is a tool or algorithm designed to organize participants into a competition format based on specific rules and constraints.

---

## 1. Inputs
The generator starts by gathering basic information:
- **Participants**: A list of teams or individuals.
- **Tournament Type**: Examples include round-robin, single elimination, double elimination, or Swiss-style.
- **Match Constraints**: Rules like time, location, or maximum number of matches per round.
- **Seeding**: Determines the initial ranking of participants, often based on prior performance.

## 2. Tournament Types
Hereâ€™s how different tournament types work:

### a) Round-Robin
- Each participant competes against every other participant.
- For `n` participants, the total number of matches is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
- The generator creates a schedule ensuring all participants meet each other once (or more, for multiple rounds).

### b) Single Elimination
- Participants are arranged in a bracket.
- A participant is eliminated after one loss.
- The generator ensures the number of matches leads to a single winner. If the number of participants isn't a power of 2, byes (automatic advancement) are assigned.

### c) Double Elimination
- Participants are eliminated only after two losses.
- Two brackets are maintained: **Winners' Bracket** and **Losers' Bracket**.
- A final match (or series) determines the champion between the winners of the two brackets.

---

## 3. Scheduling
The generator uses rules to create matchups:
- **Fairness**: Ensures balanced pairings and avoids repetitive matchups.
- **Time Constraints**: Matches are scheduled considering time slots or locations.
- **Randomization**: Seeds may introduce randomness to balance the competition.

---

## 4. Bracket Management
- **Dynamic Adjustments**: Some formats (like Swiss or double elimination) require real-time updates as matches conclude.
- **Visualization**: The generator often outputs a bracket or schedule for easy reference.

## 5. Example Algorithm (Single Elimination)
For \( n \) participants:
1. **Seeding**:
   - Rank participants (randomly or by skill).
   - Arrange them so higher seeds face lower seeds in early rounds.
2. **Match Pairing**:
   - Pair participants for the first round (e.g., seed 1 vs. seed 8, seed 2 vs. seed 7).
3. **Advancement**:
   - Winners advance to the next round.
   - Continue until one participant remains.
4. **Byes**:
   - If \( n \) is not a power of 2, give byes to the top seeds in the first round.

## 6. Output
The result is a schedule or bracket showing:
- Who plays whom.
- When and where the matches will take place.
- Final standings or results as the tournament progresses.
